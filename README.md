# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction Web Application

This project is a Flask-based web application for predicting the quality of wine based on various chemical properties. The model was trained using the Wine dataset, and the prediction models are saved as `.pkl` files. Users can interact with the app to input wine features, select a model, and receive predictions on wine quality.

## 🌟 Project Overview

The Wine Quality Prediction app provides a user-friendly interface to input wine characteristics and choose between two custom logistic regression models:

- **Logistic Regression MCE Model**
- **Logistic Regression OVA Model**

The app uses a trained scaler to normalize inputs before predicting the wine quality.
